Quick Start
===========

Doomseeker has the following dependencies:
* Qt - Version 4.5 or later (Qt5 recommended), requires the QtCore, QtGui, and QtNetwork modules.
* Optionally zlib and libbz2

You will also need CMake to generate the Makefile and/or project files.
Supported compilers are GCC and MSVC.

On Ubuntu the Qt packages required are qtbase5-dev, qtmultimedia5-dev, and qttools5-dev.

Linux compilation instructions:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install

----------------------------------------

Quick Build for Redistribution
==============================

Assuming we are in "./doomseeker-src" directory, which is the
root directory of this repo.

mkdir ../build
cd ../build
cmake \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr \
  -DCMAKE_SKIP_RPATH=true \
  ../doomseeker-src
QT_HASH_SEED=1 make -j `nproc`

----------------------------------------

Deterministic Builds
====================

Qt Tools
--------

Qt tools produce random output due to use of QHash, which orders its elements
using a randomized seed. The seed can be forced with QT_HASH_SEED env. variable.
It is sufficient to set it for make, but always set it to the same value:

  QT_HASH_SEED=1 make

Install Prefix
--------------

Install prefix, set by CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX path, is passed
as a #define to the built executable. If your build is meant
for distribution, it is important to set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
to /usr. Here are some examples:

  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local

The resulting 'doomseeker' executable will differ depending
on this #define.
