This directory contains library dependencies.

These dependencies can be download from various, scattered sites on
the Internet. Because Windows has many different C++ compilers it is difficult
to find builds of all libraries that will be compatible with your compiler.
Even each Visual Studio version is a different compiler.

This directory exists to make compilation process on Windows easier.

Contents of this directory are normally not needed on various GNU/Linux
distros as these dependencies should be provided through package manager
or other method appropriate for given distro.
