This directory contains library dependencies in binary format.
These dependencies can be download from the various, scattered sites on 
the Internet. Because Windows has many different C++ compilers it is difficult
to find builds of all libraries that will be compatible with your compiler.

This directory exists to make compilation process (on Windows) easier.
