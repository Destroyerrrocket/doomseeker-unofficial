This directory contains a set of tools for preparing auto-updates.

 * build-update-kit-win32.rb
    A script with predefined package configurations. It's designed to
    automatically create packages that work with Doomseeker. Given a source
    directory and update channel name, it will generate packages for Doomseeker
    and all plugins. It will also generate the update-info.js file.

 * create-packages-win32.rb
    Given a directory containing the set of files that make up a release,
    laid out as they are when installed and a JSON package config file,
    this tool generates a package.zip for the release
    and a package.zip.xml listing all the files that make up the release.

 * config-template.json

    This is a template for the config file that specifies:

    - How to partition the files that make up an installed application
      into a package.
    - The path of the main binary to run after the update completes
    - The name of the updater binary to download as part of the update

    This is the simplest possible package configuration, where all files for
    a release are placed in a single package.  This means that the whole
    package will need to be downloaded to install the update.
