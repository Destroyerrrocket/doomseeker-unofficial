Additional notes to Mendeley Update Installer
Written by Zalewa, November 2012
================================================================================
The source code was downloaded from head of the Mendeley Update Installer
on 2nd November 2012. Problems described below may be the result of downloading
from head intead of a tag. After a few tweaks the updates become usable again.

First of all the "create-packages.rb" is an original script file. It should
serve as a template only and not as an actually usable script. There are two
things this script does wrong:
1. It assumes that Windows user has sha1sum.exe, xmllint.exe and zip.exe
   programs in their %PATH%. These programs are not a part of any Windows
   so no Windows user will have them. These files have been included in this 
   repo together with the fixed script. The original Mendeley repo doesn't
   have them at the time when this doc is written.
2. The script omits putting the updater.exe into the package. Later, when the
   updater.exe is given such package it complains that this file is missing
   from the archive and refuses to work.
   
To fix both these problems a "create-packages-win32.rb" was created. This
file is the one to be used on Windows platforms.

Consult "..\README.md" file for instructions on how to prepare
and perform updates.
