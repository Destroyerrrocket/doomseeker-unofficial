# The data columns are following:
# - country ip2c name
#     Used to search for country flag. This must be one of the flags names
#     from resources.qrc.
# - language_counry
#     Effective name of the translation file (.ts, .qm). This is also used
#     to load Qt translation file which has "qt_" prefix in its name.
#     For example Polish translation is located in "pl_PL" and "qt_pl" files.
#     Qt handles name resolving in a way that progressively strips away parts 
#     after underscores until the file is found.
# - nice name
#     Displayed to user in language selection menu. This should be written in
#     the language it translates to.
