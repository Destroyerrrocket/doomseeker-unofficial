/**
 * @brief Filters UpdatePackage information basing on what is requested
 *        by the program.
 *
 * Firstly packages are filtered by specified channel name: setChannel().
 * All packages which do not fit this criteria are discarded.
 *
 * Next these filters are applied:
 * - Packages which are told to be ignored through setIgnoreRevisions()
 *   method. @b However if at least one package goes through the filters
 *   then this list is itself ignored. The ignore list by itself is designed
 *   to prevent nagging users for updates which they already discarded.
 *   But if an update for one of the package appears it's probable
 *   that it may require update for other packages as well due to incompatible
 *   interfaces between the main program and the plugins.<br>
 *   @b TL;DR: If we update one of them, then we'll be only safe if we update
 *   all of them.
 * - Packages which have the same revision number as the ones already
 *   installed are discarded. This is hardcoded into the class.
