/**

 * @brief Simple dialog box where user can pick path to IWAD and
 * additional game files.
 *
 * This dialog box contains two input widgets and standard
 * accept/cancel buttons. User can pick a single IWAD from a combo
 * box, and multiple other files (PWADs, Dehacked patches, etc.) using
 * a list that also accepts drag'n'drops. Files can also be browsed
 * using OS standard file browser dialog.
 *
 * Doomseeker will attempt to find all known IWADs in "File paths"
 * that are configured by the user. It will populate the combo box
 * with all found paths. If it's desired, the dialog can be instructed
 * to select a default IWAD by name using setIwadByName() method.
 *
 * If dialog is "Accepted", results can be obtained through
 * filePaths() and iwadPath() accessors.
