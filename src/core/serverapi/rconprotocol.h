/**
 * @ingroup group_pluginapi
 * @brief Remote console protocol interface.
 *
 * Doomseeker can be used to administrate remote server
 * through the server's remote console protocol. Implementation, if provided,
 * is returned through an instance of Server that also needs to be
 * implemented by the plugin.
 *
 * @section impl_and_comm Implementation and communication with Doomseeker.
 *
 * A working example of implementation is provided in Zandronum plugin
 * source code.
 *
 * Plugin implementation needs to provide all <b>[Pure Virtual]</b>
 * methods.  Doomseeker starts by asking user for RCon password. At
 * this point RConProtocol isn't even called yet. Once user provides a
 * password, the first call to sendPassword() is made. It's at this
 * point that the RConProtocol implementation should first establish
 * connection with the server, interpret any responses and send the
 * password. It's up to the plugin to determine when setConnected()
 * should be called and what conditions mean that it should be set to
 * true or false. All messages that should be displayed by Doomseeker
 * should be emitted through messageReceived() signal. This also
 * includes important error messages such as "You've been banned from
 * this server." If password specified by the user is invalid, an
 * invalidPassword() signal should be emitted so that Doomseeker can
 * ask the user for correction. When connection is lost or closed, a
 * disconnected() signal should be emitted. This signal should also be
 * emitted after a call to disconnectFromServer(), but only after the
 * plugin is certain that the connection is in fact closed. This
 * allows Doomseeker to close connection gracefully. Keep in mind that
 * Doomseeker can also call disconnectFromServer() even if it already
 * knows that isConnected() returns false. In this case it's also
 * expected that the plugin will emit disconnected() signal, even if
 * that's the only thing that it'll do in its implementation of
 * disconnectFromServer(). Each command input by the user is sent
 * through sendCommand() slot.
 *
 * There are also some utilities that allow Doomseeker to update
 * certain parts of display. For example, whenever server name changes
 * (or is first made known), the serverNameChanged() signal should be
 * emitted. Similar goes for player list which has corresponding
 * playerListUpdated() signal, upon which Doomseeker accesses
 * players() list.
