 *        that can be OR'ed logically as a single integer.
 *
 * DMFlag is basically a setting that is toggleable between enabled/disabled
 * state, and a bunch of DMFlags can be represented as bitflags that can be
 * OR'ed, XOR'ed, and AND'ed together.
 *
 * DMFlag objects can be put into DMFlagsSection collection.
 *
 * DMFlag is bound by the same human-readable name and 'internal' name rules as
 * the DMFlagsSection class. Refer to the documentation of that class to see
 * the details. Remember that it's absolutely forbidden to use QObject::tr() in
 * the 'internal' name. Each DMFlag should have an unique name within
 * its DMFlagsSection.
 *
 * This structure is safe to copy.

 *        together to form a meaningful value.
 *
 * This object is safe to copy. If you need to clone the section but omit
 * the DMFlag definitions stored within it, use copyEmpty() method instead.
 *
 * DMFlagsSection uses two names - name() for human-readable purposes and
 * internalName() for identification within the system. name() should normally
 * be wrapped in a QObject::tr() call. It's also allowed to only specify the
 * 'internal' name and the human-readable name will be the same. The 'internal'
 * name is expected to stay the same between versions of Doomseeker as it will
 * be used in configuration files that should be usable for extended period
 * of time (years) without being resaved. The human-readable name can be changed
 * at whim.
 *
 * Each section in a plugin should have an unique internalName().
 *
 * The 'internal' name should be as friendly to any underlying Operating System
 * as possible. Using only lower-case letters and digits is enforced. If plugin
 * specifies invalid characters in the 'internal' name, the proper format will
 * be coerced; all invalid characters will be removed and all letters
 * lowercased. The human-readable name(), when not specified explicitly, will
 * use the specified 'internal' name, but will have all original characters
 * intact. What's forbidden is wrapping the 'internal' name in a QObject::tr()
 * call. Unfortunately, Doomseeker has no means to detect whether string is
 * translated or not, so the responsibility to ensure that it isn't falls on the
 * author of the plugin. It is very important to pay attention to this as the
 * plugin may appear to work correctly at first but break in certain cases only,
 * for example when user saves game configurations while using one language
 * translation and tries to load them when using another.
 *
 * Some call examples:
 *
 * @code
 * DMFlagsSection dmflags("dmflags");
 * DMFlagsSection compatFlags("compatflags", tr("Compat. Flags"));
