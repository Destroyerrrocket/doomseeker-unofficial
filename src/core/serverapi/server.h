/**
 * @ingroup group_pluginapi
 * @brief A representation of a server for a given game.
 *
 * This is a multipurpose class that represents a game server in general.
 * Server data is stored here, as well as interfaces for following operations
 * are present:
 * - parsing packets received when challenging the server, and creating contents
 *   of the challenge packets;
 * - accessing game ExeFile for current Server (which can be a non-standard
 *   executable derived from information provided by the server itself);
 * - spawning GameClientRunner object that generates "join" command line;
 * - RConProtocol;
 * - Server's tooltip generator: TooltipGenerator;
 * - PathFinder configured to find WADs for this server, where plugins
 *   may define a customized behavior.
 *
 * Doomseeker is designed in a way that ownership of Server instances are
 * relegated to QSharedPointer objects. These objects allow Doomseeker
 * to push the Server to various asynchronous operations and not worry
 * that the server object will be deleted before it stops being needed.
 * This way we avoid references to dangling pointers, but there's also a price.
 * Any class that requires a QSharedPointer<Server> will lead to undefined
 * behavior (crash) if plain Server* pointer is passed. Instead, Server
 * provides a self() method that returns a reference that is safe to be casted
 * to QSharedPointer. This method should also be used instead of 'this' pointer.
 * The drawback is that <b>self() is not available until the object is fully
 * constructed, thus its use in constructor is prohibited.</b>
 *
 * ServerPtr is basically Doomseeker's alias for QSharedPointer<Server>.
 *
 * @attention
 * Some methods in this class are virtual by the natural means provided by C++,
 * but some are marked as virtual in documentation only and can be customized
 * through method pointer setters.
