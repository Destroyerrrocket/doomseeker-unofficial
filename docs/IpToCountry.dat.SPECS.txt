IpToCountry.dat
---------------

IpToCountry.dat is a binary file that holds information that can match
IPv4 addresses to geographical locations. This format was designed
specifically for use in Doomseeker. The information stored within is
limited to what Doomseeker needs to provide the Ip-to-Country
functionality and doesn't contain anything else.

Format

Legend

  BYTE - 1 byte
  USHORT - 2 bytes, unsigned
  ULONG - 4 bytes, unsigned
  STRING - null terminated text of arbitrary length
  EOF - End of file
  GeoID - a geographical or political entity that can be recognized
          as having a set of IPv4 addresses assigned to it

  All multibyte values are little-endian


Main file structure

  Field   | Size      | Description
  ----------------------------------
  Magic   | 4 * BYTE  | "IP2C" text
  Version | USHORT    | Integer. Always '2'
  Data    | Until EOF | Contains the whole database payload and
          |           | continues until the end of file.

The 'Data' structure contains a series of GeoID tables with content
structured in the following way. The number of IP Blocks varies between
each table.

  Field           | Size        | Description
  --------------------------------------------
  Location Name   | STRING      | Human-readable full name of the location:
                  |             | name of a country or of a larger geographical
                  |             | or political structure. Doomseeker uses
                  |             | this text for displaying the country name.
                  |             |
  Location ID     | STRING      | This is usually a 3-character code of
                  |             | the location. For countries this is the
                  |             | ISO ALPHA-3 Code. Doomseeker matches
                  |             | country flags to IPs basing on this code.
                  |             | Usually only the political country entities
                  |             | are present here, however an exception for
                  |             | this is a generic location somewhere in
                  |             | the European Union that is expressed as
                  |             | a 2-character STRING "EU".
                  |             |
  IP Blocks Count | ULONG       | Amount of IP Blocks for this GeoID
                  |             |
  IP Blocks       | 8 * <COUNT> | Pairs of IPs repeating as many times
                  |             | as specified by the "Count" field.

A singular "IP Block" structure denotes a range of IPs understood as a set
of continuous integer numbers beginning from the "Begin" IPv4 and ending
on the "End" IPv4. A GeoID can have many non-continuous IPv4 addresses
assigned to it, so while the continuous range can be expressed as a min-max
integer pair, the non-continuous ranges are expressed as separate blocks.

  Field | Size  | Description
  ----------------------------
  Begin | ULONG | First IPv4 in the block, inclusive
  End   | ULONG | Final IPv4 in the block, inclusive


In current version (2) of the database the data is not presented in any
particular order. Doomseeker's parser loads the data into hashtables
where it is eventually ordered solely by the "IP Block Begin" value
with GeoID information duplicated for each non-continuous block
belonging to the same GeoID.
